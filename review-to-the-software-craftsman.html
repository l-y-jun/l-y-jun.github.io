<h3>Robert.C.Martin</h3>
<p>Author's career is differ from that of mine.
Also he is even younger than me.
Different working locations, culture, and even nationality.
Only one Common between author and me is we are programmers.
That's enough.</p>
<p>This book is whole about repeating the professionalism.
not only as an programmer, but as organizational sight.
yeah, this book is about software craftsman.
it handles large amount and areas like:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>design pattern</li>
<li>pair programming</li>
<li>TDD to process</li>
<li>dealing with tight date planning</li>
<li>Job interviews for developers and hiring document writting</li>
<li>coworking methods with coworker and manager</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This book is for some developers, team-leaders, managers who return from his working and whisper himself &quot;Today was hard and awesome. nice works i did.&quot;</p>

<h3>Junehan</h3>
<p>As a developer, I sometimes get mazed by myself.
And i can't tell myself i'm doing that good, and keep my head towards to something great because of me or little out world happenings around me which usually happends and useless.
But i know i did something towards to be better many days, while passed some deep lazy days on this journey, me doing this works for about 2 year and few months, this is something handle me tight.
This book was just like someone who Could tell me you're ideals, hopes and little steps towards Great masters was not useless but means. so keep my faith hard and be hard for me much more.
As Robert.C.martin said in recommodation, this book does cover real bunch of areas in software development. <em>(so i skipped really a few chapters...)</em></p>

<h3>Refactoring in pragmatic conception</h3>
<p>Refactoring without pragmatic conception is highly dangerous.
<em>Behave as a professional</em> means <strong>understanding the tradeoffs.</strong>
Entire system can be improved at sametime, but that can be useless.
Refactoring the legacy Base code which is changed for few years is meaningless.
After all, if Codebase need not be modified? then no need to refactor them.
Refactoring should start from more frequently modified codebase.
BoyScout rule should applied to not everything but actual specified part, which is understood to needs modifing.</p>

<li>How many code base are need to be modified?</li>

<h3>Future preparing abstraction: YAGNI</h3>
<p>Without any reasonables from currect need, Abstractions with concerns like &quot;Have to prepare the future.&quot; will make application Trash.
Why? We don't know what exact part will need to be modified, so abstraction by more complexity with more appliable code will be generated.
<em>Preparing Application to be evolve, change in someday's Possibilities</em> could be considered as Smart actions,

<div class="section" id="before-applying-design-pattern">
<h3>Before applying design pattern</h3>
<p>Before applying the pattern,
Refactoring which is proper to problem should be tried to make code Simple design and follow the <strong>SOLID principle.</strong>
After that, if our refactored solution is simmiar to specific design pattern, We can refactor them to be oriented by that pattern.</p>

<h3>General Code</h3>
<p>General code can have more expandabilities then non general ones,

<div class="section" id="a-code-with-craftsmanship-and-pragmatism">
<h3>A Code with Craftsmanship and Pragmatism</h3>
<p>Code written in Fast doesn't mean dirty code.
Large Project doesn't mean BDUF(big design up-front), or over-engineering.
Clean and fine written code is always important.
Clean and fine code will be the base of safe-changing by the need of business.
It is best way to help business that to change code in fast speed depends on spec changes.</p>

<h3>Craftsman's role</h3>
<p>As a craftsman, our role is to low the price of product while not making issue.
To do so, we need to master the Good Execution conventions and stand in Pragmatic.
In many different Contexts, We have to understand what each conventions values are.</p>
